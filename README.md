## Guides

The information on the [DIY BIlling](https://diy-billing.projects.macroscope.io/) website is structured in 'Guides'. Each guide will give a user a start-to-finish overview of how to perform analysis on an AWS Service. Guides include details on IAM Permissions, sample code for analysis, and in-depth explanations of query results and the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) fields required for analysis.
