# [DIY Billing Project](https://diy-billing.projects.macroscope.io/)



## Introduction

Engineers are spending too much time and money trying to understand and control their AWS Cloud Costs. The DIY Billing Project is a set of guides to share code with Engineers who are working on AWS Cost Analysis to quickly query billing data to figure out what is driving your costs. 

This project was created and is maintained by the team at [Macroscope](https://www.macroscope.io). If you're interested in learning more about what we're building and how we're working to solve the 'cloud cost' problem for engineers, [sign up](https://preview.macroscope.io/sign-up) to get a product demo and learn about our beta program!



## Guides

The information on the [DIY BIlling](https://diy-billing.projects.macroscope.io/) website is structured in 'Guides'. Each guide will give a user a start-to-finish overview of how to perform analysis on an AWS Service. Guides include details on IAM Permissions, sample code for analysis, and in-depth explanations of query results and the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) fields required for analysis.
