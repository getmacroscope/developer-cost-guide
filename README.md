# [Developer's Guide to AWS Costs](https://developer-costs-guide.projects.macroscope.io)



## Introduction

Engineers are spending too much time and money trying to understand and control their AWS Cloud Costs. The DIY Billing Project is a set of guides that share code with Engineers who are working on AWS Cost Analysis to enable quick billing analysis to find cost drivers.

Thanks for reading! Check out our [website](https://www.macroscope.io/sign-up) if you'd like to see the software the Macroscope team is building.

## Guides

The information on the [Developer's Guide to AWS Costs](https://developer-costs-guide.projects.macroscope.io) website is structured in 'Guides'. Each guide will give a user a start-to-finish overview of how to perform analysis on an AWS Service. Guides include details on IAM Permissions (when required), sample code for analysis, and in-depth explanations of query results and the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) fields required for analysis.
