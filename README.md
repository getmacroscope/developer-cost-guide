# [DIY Billing Project](https://diy-billing.projects.macroscope.io/)



## Introduction

Engineers are spending too much time and money trying to understand and control their AWS Cloud Costs. The DIY Billing Project is a set of guides that share code with Engineers who are working on AWS Cost Analysis to enable quick billing analysis to find cost drivers.

Thanks for reading! Check out our [website](https://macroscope.io/sign-up) if you'd like to see the software the Macroscope team is building. If you have questions or want to suggest a topic for analysis, check out our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/getmacroscope/diy-billing/discussions) page or get in touch directly at [diybilling@macroscope.io](mailto:diybilling@macroscope.io).



## Guides

The information on the [DIY BIlling](https://diy-billing.projects.macroscope.io/) website is structured in 'Guides'. Each guide will give a user a start-to-finish overview of how to perform analysis on an AWS Service. Guides include details on IAM Permissions (when required), sample code for analysis, and in-depth explanations of query results and the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) fields required for analysis.
